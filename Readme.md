# Youtube-Clone (Backend)

A production-grade backend clone of Youtube, designed for scalability, maintainability, and real-world deployment. This project demonstrates best practices by separating concerns into different folders such as utils, middlewares, controllers, and routes.

## Features

- RESTful API for video streaming and user interaction
- Modular folder structure:
  - **/utils**: Helper functions and utilities
  - **/middlewares**: Authentication, error handling, logging, and more
  - **/controllers**: Route logic and business rules
  - **/routes**: API endpoints grouped by resource
- Secure authentication and authorization
- Upload and stream video content
- User accounts, likes, comments, and subscriptions
- Scalable and easy to extend

## Tech Stack

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (or your chosen database)
- JWT for authentication
- Multer or similar for file uploads
- (List any other libraries you use)

## Project Structure

```
/utils        # Utility/helper functions
/middlewares  # Express middlewares (auth, error handling, etc.)
/controllers  # Request handlers for each route
/routes       # API route definitions
/models       # Database schemas/models
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14+ recommended)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB instance (local or remote)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/anmolp-03/Youtube-Clone.git
cd Youtube-Clone
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and add your environment variables (example):
```
PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/youtube-clone
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

### Running the Server

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

API will be available at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

## Usage

- Use API endpoints to create users, upload videos, fetch video lists, like/comment, and more
- Integrate with a frontend or use Postman to test
